Hello! My name is Aldrim, I am a beginner  | 
in the field of information technology,    |
if you notice errors in my code,           |
or if you want to give me some advice,     |
write to me at email:                      |

And now let's go to the program:           | 
The calculator is located in the path:     |
Calculator beta v0.1\Debug\setup.exe       |
It was written in the C++ programming      |                                                   BETA v0.1
language and created in Visual Studio      |
based on Windows Forms.                    |
-------------------------------------------|
Since this is a beta version,              |
the calculator does not work as it should, |
but I will improve it, the next            |
update will be dedicated to freely moving  |
the window around the entire desktop and   |
eliminating small errors.                  |
                                           |
Thanks for reading!                        |
